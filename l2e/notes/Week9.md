# Week 9 Report

This report focuses on more paper and ideas about paper.

Overall narrative: "data generation using high-level structure information from NLP"

Analysis:

First-degree (Direct Explanation) (Explain the property of the subject) -- explaination that directly explains the subject of the sentence (From COPA, looks like the majority of the corpus)

Example: "The man killed a duck." "Becuase he is hungry."

Second-degree (Explanation as the property of object)

Example: 

"The parents forbade their children from watching the movie."	

Orig: "The movie was rated R."	L2E: "It was too upsetting ."



TODO:

1. Evaluate gender agreement (instead of just verb agreement) (similar to Linzen et al.)
