## Dependency Pattern Instructions

```python
depdency_patterns = [
    "still": [
        {"POS": "RB", "S2": "advmod", "S1": "parataxis", "acceptable_order": "S1 S2"},
        {"POS": "RB", "S2": "advmod", "S1": "dep", "acceptable_order": "S1 S2"},
    ],
    "for example": [
        {"POS": "NN", "S2": "nmod", "S1": "parataxis", "head": "example"}
    ],
    "but": [
        {"POS": "CC", "S2": "cc", "S1": "conj", "flip": True}
    ],
]
  
```

`Acceptable_order: "S1 S2""`: a flag to reject weird discourse term like "then" referring to previous sentence, 
but in itself a S2 S1 situation. In general it's hard to generate a valid (S1, S2) pair.

`flip: True`: a flag that means rather than S2 connecting to marker, S1 to S2; it's S1 connecting to marker, 
then S1 connects to S2.

`head: "example""`: for two words, which one is the one we use to match dependency patterns. 

## TODO

[x] switch to better (more automatic) dependency parsing with corenlp
[x] finish making test cases and editing parser for all discourse markers in english
[x] rewrite producer
[ ] run model on new dataset for English
[ ] get Chinese and Spanish corpora
[ ] check parser on a few examples of English BookCorpus data
[ ] record dependency patterns for Chinese and Spanish
[ ] what if this doesn't work?

## Parsing performance

Out of 176 Wikitext-103 examples:
* accuracy = 0.81 (how many correct pairs or rejections overall?)
* precision = 0.89 (given that the parser returns a pair, was that pair correct?)

This excludes all "still" examples, because they were terrible.
