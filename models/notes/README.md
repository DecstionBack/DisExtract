# Week 1 Report

## Summary

1. We investigated **old** experiment data, we can't conclude that `because` is learned badly because algorithms fail to understand causal relations (or acquire real-world knowledge) (confounding factor: number of training examples in corpus)
2. We then follow up with **balanced experiments**. We conclude that both `because` and `but` are the hardest discourse markers to learn.
3. Analyze the error examples with visualization. Work in progress. Visualizing LSTM is still an active area of research.
4. Preprocessed English Gigaword (newswire). Preliminary pre-processing is finished. Want to know how to move forward.
